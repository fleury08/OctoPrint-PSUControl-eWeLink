> ```

## Configuration

1.  Open **OctoPrint Settings** and navigate to **PSU Control - eWeLink** (under Plugins).

    *   This will check your credentials and fetch your available devices.

## Security

This plugin takes security seriously:
*   **Obfuscated Storage**: Credentials are NOT stored in plain text. They are obfuscated using XOR with a local salt in `config.yaml` to prevent casual exposure.
*   **UI Masking**: Passwords are masked (`********`) in the settings UI and stripped from the browser memory.
*   **Secure API**: Credentials are transmitted to the eWeLink API over HTTPS.

## Releasing

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. **Bump the version** in `pyproject.toml` (line 7: `version = "X.X.X"`)
2. **Update** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. **Push to main** - the workflow automatically:
   - Runs unit tests
   - Creates a GitHub release with the version tag
   - Generates release notes

You can also trigger a release manually from the **Actions** tab → **Release** → **Run workflow**.

> **Note**: The plugin registry metadata is in a separate repo: [`plugins.octoprint.org/_plugins/psucontrol_ewelink.md`](https://github.com/OctoPrint/plugins.octoprint.org). Update it when changing plugin description, compatibility, or screenshots.
